# VentedSpeakerBox-Calculator

Vented Speaker Box Calculator using Windows API

This project was originally written in python3.7 as a quick way to create vented speaker boxes dimensions, as recalculating these things by hand are very tedious. After making a a GUI in python, I decided to transfer it over to C++ using the windows API. This was done because it both looks more professional, and the Object Object-oriented programming sytem in C++ is much easier to work with than python's. This was written in C++, using Visual Studio 2019.
